			 <p>I was wondering that the hell is wrong with my internet connection. It was sluggish and threw errors every now and then. Turned out the issue was (as always) DNS.</p>
<p>One of the DNS servers I was using has been discontinued (dns0.eu). As I also had AdGuard on my router to out parallel request to all specified DNS servers, one can see why there might have been issues.</p>

		<a href="https://nikokultalahti.com/2025/08/28/migrating-from-wallabag-to-karakeep/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-08-28 18:47:37 &#43;0200">Aug 28, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today, I migrated my read-later list (and archived links) from <a href="https://wallabag.org/">Wallabag</a> to <a href="https://karakeep.app/">Karakeep</a>.</p>
<p>I self-host both of these applications on my Synology DS224+ NAS.</p>
<p>It turned out, that migrating the links from Wallabag to Karakeep is not as straight-forward as exporting from Wallabag and importing into Karakeep. The reason being that there were no file-format that Wallabag could export to that could be imported to Karakeep.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing is exporting the links from Wallabag as json, converting that to html and importing that into Karakeep. Worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/discussions/581">this discussion on GitHub</a> I found <a href="https://github.com/axilleas">axilleas comment</a> that included a ruby script that I used to do the conversion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://projectbluefin.io/">Bluefin</a> on my <a href="https://frame.work/fi/en/laptop13">Framework 13 laptop</a> so here&rsquo;s what I did step-by-step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exported the links from Wallabag as json file into a folder on my computer (let&rsquo;s say <code>~/Temp)</code> and renamed the file as archived_links.json</li>
<li>Spun up Ubuntu container using Distroshelf</li>
<li>Used terminal to enter the container, updated it and installed ruby (and nano) with <code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install ruby-full nano</code></li>
<li>The way Distroshelf works (at least on Bluefin) is that it mounts my home folder to any created container, so I only had to run <code>cd ~/Temp</code> to enter the folder with the exported file</li>
<li>I created a new file with <code>touch wallabag-json-to-html-karakeep.rb</code></li>
<li>I opened the file with <code>nano wallabag-json-to-html-karakeep.rb</code> and pasted the code from the link above into it, saved and closed the file</li>
<li>I ran <code>ruby wallabag-json-to-html-karakeep.rb archived_links.json archived_links.html</code></li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. A new file was created, which could be imported (successfully) into Karakeep. I <a href="https://gist.github.com/nikokultalahti/29ac6869176491bd9b761a8a0503b9a9">created a gist of the code</a>, which hopefully makes it a bit more accessible than browsing through GitHub discussions. As said, credits for the code goes to <a href="https://github.com/axilleas">axilleas on GitHub</a>.</p>

			 <p>Decided to give Karakeep a try after previously using Wallabag. Seems that it’s  not possible to just export-import the links between these apps. Likely some json to html is needed. #selfhosting</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Alright, DNS has propagated, and my domain is now pointing to <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog&rsquo;s</a> servers where this site is hosted. Yay! 🥳</p>
<p>As said, my website is now hosted on micro.blog. The past two years I was using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost CMS</a>, which I myself on Hetzner&rsquo;s VPS (they have a location in Finland) using Docker. While the maintenance and keeping Ghost updated was relatively simple, I felt the setup (and Ghost) was quite heavy for my needs.</p>
<p>After giving it a minute or two, this is what I came up with that I&rsquo;d like to achieve with my website and the way it&rsquo;s hosted/:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just lowering the barrier for writing</li>
<li>Ability to write &amp; publish on mobile</li>
<li>Be able to customize the site if I want</li>
<li>Make my website the central place on the web where I post, from where it can (optimally automatically) be distributed to other relevant channels where I reside (such as <a href="https://mas.to/@nikokultalahti">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nikokultalahti">LinkedIn</a>), as per <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">Indieweb&rsquo;s POSSE ideology/practice</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There would have been different solutions and ways of achieving all of the above. However, I&rsquo;ve known and been following micro.blog for several years. I knew it would fit the bill and the cost would be roughly the same as the VPS at Hetzner&rsquo;s, so I decided to give micro.blog a proper try. So here we are.</p>
<p>I looked through the built-in themes and some other Hugo themes on Github, but eventually opted using <a href="https://github.com/joshdaws0n/microwave">joshdaws0n&rsquo;s Microwave</a> theme built for micro.blog, in which I made a couple of changes that I needed. I have some additional ideas, but this will do for now.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t need to manage any servers and I can write and publish short post without titles (like a social media posts) that get automatically published on Mastodon and LinkedIn (if I so choose) with a link back to my site.</p>
<p>What I have not decided yet - as micro.blog supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">Activity Pub </a>-  whether I will migrate my Mastodon account to the one provided by micro.blog. I&rsquo;ll leave that for later and keep using my current account for now.</p>
<p>In any case, I will keep my eye on Ghost. I love that they are open source and <a href="https://activitypub.ghost.org/">they are also doing a lot of work around Activity Pub</a> at the moment.</p>

<p>Pocket was the first read-it-later / bookmarking app I used. Many have come and gone since then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pocket has helped millions save articles and discover stories worth reading. But the way people use the web has evolved, so we’re channeling our resources into projects that better match their browsing habits and online needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they are going to spin this as there&rsquo;s no longer need for such a product in the market, I&rsquo;d argue against it. Just look at all the FOSS solutions tackling the same problem / need.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been self-hosting <a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> on my Synology NAS (DS224+) using Docker Compose/Container Manager.</p>
<p>My home network is powered by a<a href="https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt6000/"> GL.iNet Flint 2 router</a>, which is running AdGuard Home for DNS-level ad and tracker blocking. All DNS traffic in the network flows through AdGuard.</p>
<p>After setting up Miniflux, I started encountering <code>127.0.0.11:53: server misbehaving</code> errors when fetching some RSS feeds. Little by little, some individual feeds would start to show this error. Refreshing any affected feed manually in Miniflux temporarily resolved the issue, but eventually, the issue would reappear.</p>
<p>I looked through GitHub issues and searched online for a solution. Eventually, I stumbled across a discussion where someone experienced similar problems, which turned out to be related to AdGuard Home. In their case, the issue was resolved by adding their specified docker network as allowed client in Adguard. Their situation was a little different from mine, but it led me to investigate further into AdGuard  settings.</p>
<p>That’s when I found the setting called &ldquo;Rate limit&rdquo; in AdGuard Home. By default, it&rsquo;s set to 20 requests per second per client. Given that I have around 120 RSS feeds in Miniflux, it’s easy to imagine how a full feed refresh could quickly exceed that limit, causing some requests to fail.</p>
<p>I changed the &ldquo;Rate limit&rdquo; value to 0 — effectively disabling the limit. Since making that change, I haven&rsquo;t encountered any more problems with Miniflux. Everything’s been running smoothly.</p>
<p>If you’re self-hosting Miniflux (or any service that makes frequent outbound DNS requests) behind AdGuard Home, and you&rsquo;re seeing intermittent errors, check your rate limits.</p>

			 <p>Once again, I’m considering if I should entirely change my personal tech stack, both in terms of hardware and software.</p><p>This is a <strong>thought</strong> that I tend to revisit often. Actually following through, not <strong>so</strong> often.</p><p>I have had a habit of making 180 degree turns and moving to an entirely different ecosystem roughly every two years. It’s been somewhat of a joke for my friends. And a source of frustration for my wife.</p><p>Usually, I’ve shuffled between:</p><ul><li>All in Apple: iPhone, MacBook, iCloud</li><li>All in Google: Pixel phone, Chromebook, Google Workspace (not a fan of Google’s free software offering due to privacy stuff)</li></ul><p>Additionally, I’ve usually bought/subscribed to other hardware/software by Apple/Google.</p><p>Right now, I’m in my longest streak (I think going on 5th year) in one ecosystem. Currently, that’s Apple’s, for which I’m heavily (and quite happily) heavily invested in.</p><p>In the past few years, I’ve become (even) more and different ways interested in tech. Especially privacy related matters and open/source software has become a big new interest of mine.</p><p>As a result, I’ve noticed there might be other options as well in for my hardware and software needs. That being said, I’d be really interested in trying the following setup:</p>
<ul><li>Framework laptop with Linux</li><li>Pixel phone flashed with GrapheneOS</li><li>Managed Nextcloud hosting or Synology at home for storing and syncing data (files, contacts, calendar, tasks, notes etc.)</li></ul><p>I have some reservations/concerns/questions for this setup:</p><ul><li>Is any fitness / health tracker compatible with GrapheneOS?</li><li>Can GrapheneOS be used as a daily (and only) driver?</li><li>Is Nextcloud good or shit? It seems popular in the open-source community, but at the same time, people often seem to think it is garbage.</li><li>Is Synology / NAS a poor choice for a home with (regularly shitty) 4G internet connection?</li></ul><p>All this goes either facts that Framework is not shipping to Finland and I have never used GrapheneOS or anything by Synology. I have played around with Nextcloud a bit via Hetzner’s Storage Share managed hosting.</p><p>In any case, the possible switch and migration to an entirely new setup would feel and be much more laborious than before. As said, not only I’m currently deeper in the Apple ecosystem than ever with family sharing and employer-provided hardware, I have much less spare time on my hands to pull off these kinds of stunts in a timely manner.</p>

			 <p>It seems Meta is starting to offer paid subscriptions for Facebook &amp; Instagram in EU due to privacy regulations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To comply with evolving European regulations, we are introducing a new subscription option in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. In November, we will be offering people who use Facebook or Instagram and reside in these regions the choice to continue using these personalised services for free with ads, or subscribe to stop seeing ads. While people are subscribed, their information will not be used for ads.</p>
<p>People in these countries will be able to subscribe for a fee to use our products without ads. Depending on where you purchase it will cost €9.99/month on the web or €12.99/month on iOS and Android.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In general, I’m going to spin this as a positive news. By that I mean people having option to pay (with money instead of their data being exploited) for services they use is highly welcome. The part I don’t like is that it’s Meta. Me being somewhat of a privacy enthusiast, I don’t like the company, paid subs or not. Having also been on the advertiser side, I know what kind of data is collected and what it enables advertisers to do. And that’s likely not even the whole of it.</p>
<p>I wonder though, how many will find enough value in FB / IG (while valuing their privacy) that they open up their wallets? How many won’t care at all and are thinking “why would I pay”? Sadly, most of them I think.</p>

			 <p>It took a few weeks after I remembered why I don’t like Wordpress. That being said, I’m back on Ghost CMS.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, Wordpress, it’s too big (for me). I have had to use it previously for work. I didn’t like it then, don’t like it now. It just feels heavy and too bloated for me.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, the editor. I’m sure the block-editor is great for someone intimate with it. I’m not one of those people. I’m greatly confused by all the blocks/patterns/templates. I don’t understand what elements the pages/posts consist of and what I should be editing.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, plugins. I’m not sure if one is able to use Wordpress without any plugins. By the least, I was missing two-factor authentication for the admin login. That’s where the hell began. There’s shit ton of plugins to choose from with without knowing which you should go for. The most popular ones offer 67+ extra features to the one you’re after. All of them offer some of those for free, the most are paid for. You know this because you are greeted with ads on the plugin’s options menu if you dared to install it. Repeat this for each individual feature you are missing.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m now back on Ghost CMS. This time, however, I’ve self-hosted this on Hetzner Cloud (instead of managed hosting). It was a nice learning experience. I followed <a href="https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/ghost-cms-on-arm64-debian">this guide on Hetzner</a> which was a huge help. As I&rsquo;m self-hosting, I need to find a way to backup this site if things go sideways for a reason or another. If there&rsquo;s any suggestions on how to do this, I&rsquo;m happy to hear it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still quite a bit work to do with the site to get things the way I want. I tried to set up local development environment for Ghost but was not able to get it working properly (yet).</p>

			 <p>This post is a documentation I’ve written for myself for securely set up a new Raspberry Pi. Hopefully it’s some use to someone else as well.</p>
<p>The steps below have been tested for Rasperry 4 B running Raspberry Pi Lite. They might work for other models and OS’s too.</p>
<p>The assumption is that you are able to access the Raspberry Pi through SSH.</p>
<p><strong>Outline</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial configuration</li>
<li>User access</li>
<li>Secure SSH</li>
<li>Essential software</li>
<li>Automatic updates</li>
<li>Remote access</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="initial-configuration">Initial configuration</h2>
<p>Configure settings by running <code>sudo raspi-config</code> and set (at least):</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostname</li>
<li>Locale(s), set default to <code>en_US.UTF-8 UFT-8</code></li>
<li>Timezone</li>
</ul>
<p>If connected to internet by cable, disable wlan (and optionally bluetooth if not needed)</p>
<ol>
<li>Open file for editing with <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</code></li>
<li>Add the following to the file:</li>
</ol>
<p>`</p>
<h1 id="disable-wireless-services">Disable wireless services</h1>
<p>dtoverlay=disable-wifi  <br>
dtoverlay=disable-bt  <br>
`</p>
<p>Finally, reboot by running <code>sudo reboot</code></p>
<h2 id="user-access">User access</h2>
<p>If you have not set user during the creation of install image (and thus are currently using the default <code>pi</code> user):</p>
<ol>
<li>Change password for <code>pi</code> user with <code>passwd</code>
<ul>
<li>Create new user with <code>sudo adduser &lt;username&gt;</code> and add sudo priviledges with <code>sudo adduser &lt;username&gt; sudo</code></li>
<li>Delete <code>pi</code> user with <code>sudo deluser -remove-home pi</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sudo require a password
<ul>
<li>Open file for editing with <code>sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd</code></li>
<li>Find line <code>&lt;username&gt; ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code></li>
<li>Replace the line with: <code>&lt;username&gt; ALL=(ALL) PASSWD: ALL</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="secure-ssh">Secure SSH</h2>
<ol>
<li>Change default SSH port (for example to 1111)
<ul>
<li>Edit file: <code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></li>
<li>Replace <code>#Port 22</code> with <code>Port 1111</code> (or any other free/available port of your choosing</li>
<li>Save, exit and restart ssh server with <code>sudo service ssh restart</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up SSH keys
<ul>
<li>On host machine run <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519</code> and save with <code>raspberrypi</code> as file name</li>
<li>Copy keys to RPi: <code>ssh-copy-id -i raspberrypi.pub -p 1111 &lt;username@hostname&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure SSH settings with <code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>
<ul>
<li>Disable root login by uncommenting and changing: <code>PermitRootLogin no</code></li>
<li>Force pubkey authentication by uncommenting and changing: <code>PubkeyAuthentication yes</code></li>
<li>Disable password authentication by uncommenting and changing: <code>PasswordAuthentication no</code></li>
<li>Disable PAM by uncommenting and changing: <code>UsePAM no</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<li><code>sudo ufw allow https</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw logging on</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw enable</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="automatic-updates">Automatic updates</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install packages with <code>sudo apt install unattended-upgrades mailutils</code></li>
<li>Configure settings with <code>sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades</code> and:

			 <p>I’ve been using Google Workspace tools for several years now mainly due to my work at <a href="https://gappsgroup.com">Gapps</a>. I’ve always struggled with whether to use them from the Dock or as browser tabs on my Macbook. I’ve tried both approaches, but I keep switching between the two approach.</p>
<p>I like using the tools from the Dock because it’s convenient, familiar and it’s easy to cmd-tab my way around the apps. But the (digital) minimalist in me wants to keep things clean; the idea of a serene, peaceful (and beautiful?) workspace compells me to keep the Dock as tidy as possible.</p>
<p>With that in mind, there’s a somewhat endearing organization when I use apps through the browser. It feels right, keeping all the web-based tools in the same space. But unfortunately, hopping between browser tabs to do my work does not feel intuitive.</p>
<p>My current setup is somewhat of a hybrid; Google Chrome, Slack and monday.com in the Dock. In Chrome, I have pinned tabs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hub (intranet based on <a href="https://happeo.com">Happeo</a></li>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>Google Calendar</li>
<li>Google Keep</li>
<li>Hubspot</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>How do <strong>you</strong> use your web-based productivity tools? Do you prefer them alongside other apps in your dock, or do you keep everything in your browser tabs?</p>

			 <p>Finally got it working. There were quite a few issues along the way but the main revelation came when I noticed that I was able to boot from an USB 2.0 port after all. This helped narrow down the issue and eventually led to a fix that allowed me to boot from the SSD in USB 3.0 port.</p>
<p>That being said, If you are having issues with getting your Rasperry Pi to boot from an SSD, check first in which port you have the SSD plugged into. If you’re unable to boot the SSD being in the USB 3.0 port, try if it works the SSD being in the USB 2.0 port. If it does, here’s what you can try to get it to work with USB 3.0 as well. I’m going to assume that you have other things in order (such as boot order set up correctly and you are are able to boot up your Rasperry Pi one way or another).</p>
<h2 id="1-find-_idvendor_-and-_idproduct_-of-your-usb-ssd">1. Find <em>idVendor</em> and <em>idProduct</em> of your USB SSD</h2>
<p>With your SSD plugged in the Raspberry Pi, run a command <code>dmesg</code> in the terminal.</p>
<p>You might get a huge wall of text but somewhere in there, you should find information about your USB SSD that might look something like this:</p>
<p><code>[2.120121] usb 2-2: new SuperSpeed USB device number 2 using xhci_hcd [2.141723] usb 2-2: New USB device found, idVendor=2109, idProduct=3431, bcdDevice= 3.01</code></p>
<p>The important bits here are the values in <code>idVendor</code> and <code>idProduct</code>, so take a note of those. Yours likely differ from mine.</p>
<h2 id="2-edit-bootcmdlinetxt">2. Edit /boot/cmdline.txt</h2>
<p>Now, edit the mentioned file using <code>sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt</code>. In the very beginning of the file, add <code>usb-storage.quirks=idVendor:idProduct:u</code> where in the place of ìdVendor and <code>idProduct</code> you use the values from the previous step. In my case, that would be <code>usb-storage.quirks=2109:3431:u</code>.</p>
<p>Save the file, exit the editor, power off Raspberry Pi, plug the SSD into the USB 3.0 port and it should boot properly.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the issue and the fix on <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com//viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=245931">Rasperry Pi forums</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you.</p>

			 <p>Mass Effect Legendary Edition being on PS+ in last December(?) was a really nice surprise. I’ve played some Mass Effect games when they were launched, but don’t remember much of those.</p>
<p>Now having a kid and having significantly less time (understandably) for gaming, I have quite a backlog to go through and no need to purchase the newest games.
It’s been very nice going through the Mass Effect 1, looking forward to playing through the whole trilogy. That may take some time though.</p>

			 <p>Google announced the yesterday that <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/">it’s shutting down Stadia</a> as it is for consumer use. The servers will shut down on 18th of January 2023.</p>
<p>The writing had already been on the wall for a while. The first signs of Google losing faith in Stadia came in <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/">February 2021 when they announced the closing of their internal game studios</a>. Since then it’s been a downhill: many new AAA games (excluding a few) have skipped Stadia as a platform as Google has not been able (or committed enough) to attract major game publishers and developers to Stadia. As a result, the game catalog remained quite thin compared to other platforms. No games = no players = not attractive platform for publishers.</p>
<p>I bought into Stadia immediately at launch. I was attracted by the novelty of cloud gaming, the easiness of jumping into the game as well as all the potential of cloud gaming.</p>
<p>Stadia had it’s peak around the Cyberpunk 2077 launch. There were good campaigning going on ath the time, which attracted some new people to Stadia. At the same time Stadia got positive news coverage as Stadia was the best performing platform for Cyberpunk around it’s launch (which was quite a dumpsterfire).</p>
<p>Shutting down Stadia did not come as a surprise. As said, it seemed that things had already been winding down for a while, not to mention <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google is notoriusly famous for killing off it’s consumer products/services</a> that their fans love but not get enough traction.</p>
<p>Killing off services that customers use is nasty business. However, if you need to kill off a service, the way Google is now handling the shutdown of Stadia is the way to do it. Apparently, they will refund all purchases made on Stadia except the monthly Pro subscription. That means, they will refund for all the games, addons and hardware purchased. The estimation is that the refunds have been (at least mostly) processed by mid-January 2023.</p>
<p>While I enjoyed Stadia for a time, the lack of games drove me to PS5. Whatever gaming I do, it’s on that device. While I have not given (nor am I planning to, at least for the time being) a proper try to other cloud gaming solutions (such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Luna/">Amazon’s Luna</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play">Microsoft’s Game Pass</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">Nvidia’s Geforce Now</a>, <a href="https://parsec.app/cloud-gaming">Parsec</a>), I will keep an eye on how the cloud gaming industry develops.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I participated in a sales training session today that was organized for our sales team. During the training, there was a mention that the salesperson should aim to create a need for offered products/solutions that they offer. I felt I needed a bit more clarification on this so I asked. I lead off with this:</p>
<p>There’s been quite a change in how organizations and people buy in recent years. The power is on the buyer as they are easily able to research more information about their challenges, potential solutions and suitable suppliers/partners. In addition, it’s become increasingly easy to create communities and bring people with similar interests together. This means that those potential buyers exchange information and experiences with their peers, get recommendations for solutions/companies and thus go even further in their buying process before they want or are ready to talk with the sales.</p>
<p>My question was if the trainer would agree with this and what this means concerning the need creation during the sales process.</p>
<p>They said that they very much agree with this sentiment and it would make a good topic for another 1-hour training session. The quick answer in 2 minutes that we had left was this:</p>
<p>This is indeed the case when the challenge and the related solutions are (seemingly) relatively small. However, it’s up to the salesperson to identify the other, related pain points within the company. When starting to combine those, we are soon talking about relatively complex challenges and solutions. This is when they start needing help to buy and understand their issue fully.</p>
<p>For me, this was somehow both insightful and nothing new at the same time. I’ve just looked at it from another angle. New tools and technologies are not the solutions. They are merely potential. A company does not simply start providing better customer experience or improve internal communications just because they bought a shiny tool, whatever that is. Instead, harnessing the potential requires having a good look and adjusting the ways of working and maybe even the culture within the organisation.</p>
<p>When you look at it that way, really understanding the challenges at hand, potential solutions and how to implement those is no longer so easy.</p>

<h2 id="year-in-numbers">Year in Numbers</h2>
<p>At some point during the year, I realised that I find no joy in collecting all the data I used to collect. More importantly, I noticed I did not look back at the numbers nor did I make any changes or decisions based on the collected data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the data is meaningless unless put into proper action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, here are some numbers collected from various apps and sources (which admittedly, was a bit more laborious than last year):</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily average 7639 steps. Multiplying that with 365 we get in a total of 2 788 235 steps. Slightly less than in 2020, but only slightly.</li>
<li>215 workouts, however, that includes <strong>all</strong> the workouts, such as walking, stretching and walking. If we only look at strength training and calisthenics, it was 72 workouts. Less than I’d like, however overall I moved more than the year before. For 2022, more strength and calisthenics workouts.</li>
<li>Meditated 905 minutes, which is a bit lower than the year before.</li>
<li>I read 6 books.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-went-well">What went well</h2>
<ul>
<li>Was more physically active and moved more than in 2021</li>
<li>Seen some positive physique changes despite working out a bit less (but focusing on eating more)</li>
<li>Towards the end of the year joined the gym from which I got more motivation and consistency in my training</li>
<li>We’ve made positive changes to our eating habits &amp; been consistent with those throughout the year</li>
<li>Got a good amount of reading done</li>
<li>Got married and organised a superb event</li>
<li>Had a very nice summer holiday &amp; honeymoon trip around Finland</li>
<li>Survived and inevitably grew professionally; The most challenging year in my career so far in many ways</li>
<li>I had a blast “Small Christmas” party with friends</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-didnt-go-so-well">What didn’t go so well</h2>
<p>I did not work out as much as last year and many strength-related goals I set for this year were not achieved
I almost completely ignored this website and any blogging activities
Did not put enough time into practising programming and thus not achieving my goals
I forgot to follow and keep track of activities I set for this year, for which reason most of those were not fully achieved</p>
<h2 id="so-what-did-we-learn-for-2022">So what did we learn for 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you set goals, remember to track the progress on a weekly and monthly basis</li>
<li>Now that activity levels &amp; nutrition are on a good track, more focus on strength training consistency</li>
<li>If last year was more about “surviving” professionally, let’s be more deliberate this year when it comes to career progression and professional life</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I feel I did less of the things this year and/or not so much as I planned in early 2021, this was quite an eventful year with plenty of good things happening. Naturally, most of the year was coloured by the wedding with all the things that needed to be done both pre-and post-event.</p>
<p>With this, we move onwards with 2022. Time to take a good view on what I want to get out of this year and put some goals (and tracking process) in place. One of those should be related to this website.</p>

			 <p>It’s been odd and challenging year. I been thinking about doing it earlier but I guess this year finally warranted it. This is my first proper yearly review.</p>
<h2 id="year-in-numbers">Year in numbers</h2>
<p>Being quite interested in quantified-self movement, I tend to collect relatively much data about my life which I aggregate into <a href="https://gyrosco.pe/">Gyroscope</a>. Here’s some numbers that I think are worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>I took 2,9 million steps</li>
<li>I worked out 132 times</li>
<li>I spent 215 hours in virtual meetings</li>
<li>I was at the office 12 times, in total of 105 hours</li>
<li>I meditated 115 times, in total of 1031 minutes (17,13 hours)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-went-well">What went well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Travelled through Peru and visite Machu Picchu</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time with parents as I lived 8 month with them at my hometown, away from Helsinki due to COVID19</li>
<li>All the people I’m close to have been staying safe, myself included</li>
<li>Bought a car (with 500 €) during the spring which significantly made life easier</li>
<li>Proposed my (then) girlfriend at 3000 meters above the sea on top of Machu Picchu mountain. She said yes.</li>
<li>Started to plan wedding for 2021</li>
<li>I wrote in my journal every single day</li>
<li>Managed well at work, all things considered</li>
<li>Got my wisdom tooth removed. Only 3 more to go. Joy.</li>
<li>Tried frisbee golf for the first time</li>
<li>Applied to <a href="https://hive.fi">Hive Helsinki</a> and I’m quite far in the process</li>
<li>Changed bank and got considerable financial benefits from doing so</li>
<li>After a rough year the passion and excitement towards the work I do sparked up again</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-didnt-go-so-well">What didn’t go so well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Did not take enough time for myself</li>
<li>Felt quite distracted throughout the year due to the reason above</li>
<li>Not able to see and spend much time with friends due to global pandemic</li>
<li>Remote work caused some anxiety about my own performance and role at work</li>
<li>Although somewhat active, not working out as much as I would have wanted
-Not reading as much as I would have wanted</li>
<li>Not meditating as much as I would have wanted</li>
<li>The application process at Hive Helsinki is on hold due to the pandemic</li>
<li>Was not able to celebrate the engagement with friends to to the pandemic</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn">What did I learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I thought working remotely all the time wouldn’t affect me negatively. I was wrong.</li>
<li>I keep missing the country side more and more, while losing affinity towards the Helsinki</li>
<li>I need clearer and better goals for myself this year</li>
<li>I got a green card for golf</li>
<li>Learned to drive motor boat so I confidently go to our summer cabin by myself</li>
<li>Still quite interested in development and could consider it as a another/new career for myself</li>
<li>While being diplomatic and flexible serves me often quite well, I need to have a stronger opinions and take a firmer stand on matters, even though I might not initially feel like it at that time</li>

			 <p>Last Friday there was an official “bring your child to work” -day in Finland. As we often do at <a href="https://gappsgroup.com">Gapps</a>, we did things a little differently. We arranged our own “Bring your parents to work” -day.</p>
<p>The idea stemmed from the notion that many of our parents don’t necessarily fully grasp the field Gapps is on, what kind of company their child is working for and what they actually do for a living.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that the day was a huge success. There were over 40 enthusiastic parents at our office learning about Gapps, technology, modern work culture and most importantly, the work their children do.</p>
<p>Media dropped in our office as well and <a href="https://www.mtv.fi/sarja/kevennys-22-11-2019-33001025004/tanaan-vietettiin-tuo-lapsesi-toihin-paivaa-mutta-yritys-gapps-paatti-kaantaa-asian-toisin-pain-1177352">we ended up in the TV</a> (in Finnish) at the end of Finnish prime-time news.</p>
<p>Feeling very grateful of the whole day.</p>

			 <!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I recently did a 30-day challenge, during which I didn’t eat nor drink anything that contained any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>added sugar</li>
<li>cyrup</li>
<li>honey</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify, eating fruit and berries was completely OK even though they contain fructose.</p>
<p>Here’s what I found our during and after the 30 days:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was not <strong>that</strong> much of a challenge to refrain from eating sweets</li>
<li>Surprisingly many thing you can buy from a grocery store has added sugar in it</li>
<li>Avoiding added sugar lowered body weight and reduced body-fat a little bit</li>
<li>I felt a bit better (both about myself and the way I live, as well as in terms of energy) during the challenge</li>
</ol>
<p>The best finding though was that I do not grave for sweets as much as I did before the challenge. In fact, eating sweets does seem to easily make me feel a bit nauseated.</p>
<p>I have ended up paying more attention to my sugar consumption after the challenge. However, I have not completely cut added sugar out of my life as I occasionally do allow myself having, for example, some chocolate. I feel this is <strong>for me</strong> a more sensible and easier approach to maintain than 100 % avoidance of sweets for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Good is better than perfect.</p>

			 <p>A comforting thought for many.</p>
<p><em>“The gap between our subjective experience and what other peoplepick up on is known as the illusion of transparency. The reality is that other people pay much less attention to you than you think.  Accept that other people don’t usually know what you’re thinking and feeling.

			 <p>First there was Netflix, now there are several. Now it’s happening for game streaming.</p>
<p>First there was Twitch, soon there are a few. Both Google and Microsoft have begun buying influencers left and right onto their platforms (Youtube and Mixer respectively).</p>
<p>I wonder: will the audience follow influencers or will influencers eventually move (back) to where the largest audience is?</p>
