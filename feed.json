The reason being that there were no file-format that Wallabag could export to that could be imported to Karakeep.\n\nWhat I ended up doing is exporting the links from Wallabag as json, converting that to html and importing that into Karakeep. Worked flawlessly.\n\nFrom [this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/discussions/581) I found [axilleas comment](https://github.com/axilleas) that included a ruby script that I used to do the conversion.\n\nI'm using [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) on my [Framework 13 laptop](https://frame.work/fi/en/laptop13) so here's what I did step-by-step:\n\n1. Exported the links from Wallabag as json file into a folder on my computer (let's say `~/Temp)` and renamed the file as archived_links.json\n2. Spun up Ubuntu container using Distroshelf\n3. Used terminal to enter the container, updated it and installed ruby (and nano) with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ruby-full nano`\n4. The way Distroshelf works (at least on Bluefin) is that it mounts my home folder to any created container, so I only had to run `cd ~/Temp` to enter the folder with the exported file\n5. I created a new file with `touch wallabag-json-to-html-karakeep.rb`\n6. I opened the file with `nano wallabag-json-to-html-karakeep.rb` and pasted the code from the link above into it, saved and closed the file\n7. I ran `ruby wallabag-json-to-html-karakeep.rb archived_links.json archived_links.html`\n\nThat's it. A new file was created, which could be imported (successfully) into Karakeep. I [created a gist of the code](https://gist.github.com/nikokultalahti/29ac6869176491bd9b761a8a0503b9a9), which hopefully makes it a bit more accessible than browsing through GitHub discussions.

Currently, that’s Apple’s, for which I’m heavily (and quite happily) heavily invested in.</p><p>In the past few years, I’ve become (even) more and different ways interested in tech. Especially privacy related matters and open/source software has become a big new interest of mine.</p><p>As a result, I’ve noticed there might be other options as well in for my hardware and software needs. That being said, I’d be really interested in trying the following setup:</p>\n<ul><li>Framework laptop with Linux</li><li>Pixel phone flashed with GrapheneOS</li><li>Managed Nextcloud hosting or Synology at home for storing and syncing data (files, contacts, calendar, tasks, notes etc.)</li></ul><p>I have some reservations/concerns/questions for this setup:</p><ul><li>Is any fitness / health tracker compatible with GrapheneOS?</li><li>Can GrapheneOS be used as a daily (and only) driver?</li><li>Is Nextcloud good or shit? It seems popular in the open-source community, but at the same time, people often seem to think it is garbage.</li><li>Is Synology / NAS a poor choice for a home with (regularly shitty) 4G internet connection?</li></ul><p>All this goes either facts that Framework is not shipping to Finland and I have never used GrapheneOS or anything by Synology. I have played around with Nextcloud a bit via Hetzner’s Storage Share managed hosting.</p><p>In any case, the possible switch and migration to an entirely new setup would feel and be much more laborious than before. As said, not only I’m currently deeper in the Apple ecosystem than ever with family sharing and employer-provided hardware, I have much less spare time on my hands to pull off these kinds of stunts in a timely manner.</p>\n",

It’s been somewhat of a joke for my friends. And a source of frustration for my wife.</p><p>Usually, I’ve shuffled between:</p><ul><li>All in Apple: iPhone, MacBook, iCloud</li><li>All in Google: Pixel phone, Chromebook, Google Workspace (not a fan of Google’s free software offering due to privacy stuff)</li></ul><p>Additionally, I’ve usually bought/subscribed to other hardware/software by Apple/Google.</p><p>Right now, I’m in my longest streak (I think going on 5th year) in one ecosystem. Currently, that’s Apple’s, for which I’m heavily (and quite happily) heavily invested in.</p><p>In the past few years, I’ve become (even) more and different ways interested in tech. Especially privacy related matters and open/source software has become a big new interest of mine.</p><p>As a result, I’ve noticed there might be other options as well in for my hardware and software needs. That being said, I’d be really interested in trying the following setup:</p>\n<ul><li>Framework laptop with Linux</li><li>Pixel phone flashed with GrapheneOS</li><li>Managed Nextcloud hosting or Synology at home for storing and syncing data (files, contacts, calendar, tasks, notes etc.)</li></ul><p>I have some reservations/concerns/questions for this setup:</p><ul><li>Is any fitness / health tracker compatible with GrapheneOS?</li><li>Can GrapheneOS be used as a daily (and only) driver?</li><li>Is Nextcloud good or shit? It seems popular in the open-source community, but at the same time, people often seem to think it is garbage.</li><li>Is Synology / NAS a poor choice for a home with (regularly shitty) 4G internet connection?</li></ul><p>All this goes either facts that Framework is not shipping to Finland and I have never used GrapheneOS or anything by Synology. I have played around with Nextcloud a bit via Hetzner’s Storage Share managed hosting.</p><p>In any case, the possible switch and migration to an entirely new setup would feel and be much more laborious than before. As said, not only I’m currently deeper in the Apple ecosystem than ever with family sharing and employer-provided hardware, I have much less spare time on my hands to pull off these kinds of stunts in a timely manner.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "This post is a documentation I’ve written for myself for securely set up a new Raspberry Pi. Hopefully it’s some use to someone else as well.\n\nThe steps below have been tested for Rasperry 4 B running Raspberry Pi Lite. They might work for other models and OS’s too.\n\nThe assumption is that you are able to access the Raspberry Pi through SSH.\n\n**Outline**:\n\n1. Initial configuration\n2. User access\n3. Secure SSH\n4. Essential software\n5. Automatic updates\n6. Remote access\n\n## Initial configuration\n\nConfigure settings by running `sudo raspi-config` and set (at least):\n- Hostname\n- Locale(s), set default to `en_US.UTF-8 UFT-8`\n- Timezone\n\nIf connected to internet by cable, disable wlan (and optionally bluetooth if not needed)\n\n1. Open file for editing with `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`\n 2. Add the following to the file:\n\n`\n# Disable wireless services     \ndtoverlay=disable-wifi     \ndtoverlay=disable-bt     \n`\n\nFinally, reboot by running `sudo reboot`\n\n## User access\n\nIf you have not set user during the creation of install image (and thus are currently using the default `pi` user):\n\n1. Change password for `pi` user with `passwd`\n    - Create new user with `sudo adduser <username>` and add sudo priviledges with `sudo adduser <username> sudo`\n    - Delete `pi` user with `sudo deluser -remove-home pi`\n2. Make sudo require a password\n    - Open file for editing with `sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd`\n    - Find line `<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`\n    - Replace the line with: `<username> ALL=(ALL) PASSWD: ALL`\n\n## Secure SSH\n\n1. Change default SSH port (for example to 1111)\n    - Edit file: `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n    - Replace `#Port 22` with `Port 1111` (or any other free/available port of your choosing\n    - Save, exit and restart ssh server with `sudo service ssh restart`\n2. Set up SSH keys\n    - On host machine run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` and save with `raspberrypi` as file name\n    - Copy keys to RPi: `ssh-copy-id -i raspberrypi.pub -p 1111 <username@hostname>`\n3. Configure SSH settings with `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n    - Disable root login by uncommenting and changing: `PermitRootLogin no`\n    - Force pubkey authentication by uncommenting and changing: `PubkeyAuthentication yes`\n    - Disable password authentication by uncommenting and changing: `PasswordAuthentication no`\n    - Disable PAM by uncommenting and changing: `UsePAM no`\n\nFinally, restart SSH with `sudo service ssh restart`\n\n## Essential software\n\n1. Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to update packages and repositories\n2. Install Fail2ban: `sudo apt install fail2ban`\n3. Install firewall: `sudo apt install ufw`\n4. Configure and enable firewall by running following commands :\n    - `sudo ufw default deny incoming`\n    - `sudo ufw default allow outgoing`\n    - `sudo ufw allow from <ip> proto tcp to any port 1111` to allow ssh access from host to custom port\n    - `sudo ufw limit 1111`\n    - `sudo ufw allow http`\n    - `sudo ufw allow https`\n    - `sudo ufw logging on`\n    - `sudo ufw enable`\n\n## Automatic updates\n\n1. Install packages with `sudo apt install unattended-upgrades mailutils`\n2. Configure settings with `sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` and:\n    - Uncomment line `//Unattended-Upgrade: :Mail \"\";`\n    - Add local user to receive notifications by changing the line to `Unattended-Upgrade: :Mail \"<username>\";`\n3. Set periodic upgrades with `sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02periodic</code> and paste the following (the file should be empty) to enable automatic daily updates:\n\n`\nAPT::Periodic::Enable “1”;   \nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists “1”;   \nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages “1”;   \nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade “1”;   \nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval “1”;   \nAPT::Periodic::Verbose “2”;\n`\n\n## Remote access\n\n1. Install prerequisite packages with `sudo apt install lsb-release curl`\n2. Grab GPG key for Tailscale reposityory with `curl -L https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/raspbian/$(lsb_release -cs).noarmor.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null`\n3. Add Tailscale repository with `echo \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/raspbian $(lsb_release -cs) main\" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list`\n4. Update package list with `sudo apt update` and install Tailscale with `sudo apt install tailscale`\n5. Run `sudo tailscale up` and follow instructions\n6. Update UFW to allow SSH access to tailscale with: `sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0/`\n\n**Sources and more information:**\n- [https://chrisapproved.com/blog/raspberry-pi-hardening.html#configure-automatic-updates](https://chrisapproved.com/blog/raspberry-pi-hardening.html#configure-automatic-updates)\n- [https://raspberrytips.com/security-tips-raspberry-pi/](https://raspberrytips.com/security-tips-raspberry-pi/)\n- [https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.htm#securing-your-raspberry-pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.htm#securing-your-raspberry-pi)\n",
